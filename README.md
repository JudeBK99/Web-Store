#### Description:Regarding this project I had to create a web page interface including e-commerce. In order to allow customers of a store for example those of "Universal tech" to access and purchase items offered by the store while being at home.On our platforms we have a search bar to allow users to search for their items.Then we have a bar of listed articles that allow us to reach the articles concerned once we click on them.We have a presentation of the interface of the proposed articles as well as their prices and the advertising message.We have the button of purchase that is has the continuation of every article, once clicked it redirects towards the purchase of the products in questions.Here we select the color and capacity that we want.Then we press on purchase to continue with our purchase, which displays the form of submission of purchase. After that we have the footer of the web page.
